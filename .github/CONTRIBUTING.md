## Coding standards

Pull requests _must pass_ all assertions and component changes will be reviewed in Chromatic prior to consideration.

### Tips to help your PR get approved

1. Make sure your code editor supports real-time linting.
2. JSDocs are important and must be completely filled out.
3. Run `yarn build && yarn start` before submitting your PR, to ensure a build will be successful
4. Be courteous

In addition to real-time linting, you could run the following commands in your terminal (these commands are also used by Husky during a commit!)

Lint JavaScript:

```bash
yarn run lint:js
```

Lint CSS:

```bash
yarn run lint:css
```

Format your code:

```bash
yarn run format
```
