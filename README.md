## Preface

You will need the following installed on your computer:

- [Node 12+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM 6+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

The following frontend technologies are used on this project:

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)

The WordPress backend is running [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql). So familiarity with writing [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) queries is helpful.

---

## Frontend Development (Next.js)

The following instructions will standup a local install of the frontend. It queries data from the WordPress backend via GraphQL. Authentication happens via environment variable `.env.local`.

### Install Frontend

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Create an environment variable:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

*Find the environment variable credentials from `1password --> Next.js Environment Variables`. Copy & paste those credentials into `.env.local`*

Start the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Backend Info (WordPress)

A vanilla WordPress install hosted at [WP Engine](https://nextjs.wpengine.com) with the following plugins are installed:

**Advanced Custom Fields Pro** - At WebDevStudios we leverage ACF to handle custom post meta and [ACF Blocks](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/).

**reSmush.it Image Optimizer** - Keeps image sizes small by optimizing them on upload.

**WDS SSO** - Used as our internal single-sign on service.

**WP GraphQL, WP GraphiQL, and WP GraphQL JWT Authentication** - GraphQL is installed on the WordPress backend and the endpoint is: `https://nextjs.wpengine.com/graphql`

You can use GrapiQL to build queries in the [WordPress Dashboard](https://nextjs.wpengine.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-graphiql%2Fwp-graphiql.php). Those queries can be copied and pasted right into the Next.js Frontend. You can view the current list of GraphQL queries in [/lib/api.js](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter/blob/main/lib/api.js) JWT Authentication allows the frontend to talk to the backend.

**WP Migrate DB Pro** - Used for moving database and files between environments.

**There is no frontend for WordPress**, but it is running [wd_s](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s). wd_s houses `/acf-json` and other functions for building ACF Blocks. *If you try to view the WordPress frontend, you will be redirected back to the WordPress dashboard.*
