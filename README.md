# Next.js WordPress Starter <!-- omit in toc -->

WebDevStudios fork of the official Next.js WordPress [example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/cms-wordpress). Used as a starter for headless WordPress projects.

**This project is still in active development. Use at your own risk.**

## üéì Overview

### Why?

Querying a REST-API or GraphQL endpoint and looping over blog posts is where many _"how to build a headless WordPress website"_ tutorials stop. You'd be hard pressed to find anything about supporting advanced features and plugins because **_headless WordPress is hard._**

At WebDevStudios we believe that WordPress is so much more than a blog-- and our clients require support for things like: SEO, forms, previews, search, comments, authentication, custom post types, custom fields, etc...

With this starter, we've figured out the "hard stuff" and placed the sum of our knowledge into something both the community and our future projects could use as a jumping off point.

### How's this all work?

The frontend (Next.js) talks to the backend (WordPress) via GraphQL.

</details>

### 3rd Party Services

This starter uses a few 3rd party services.

<details>

- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)
- [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com)

#### Algolia

We use [WP Search with Algolia](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-search-with-algolia/) to push content indicies from WordPress to Algolia. You will need to set up a (free) account and place your API credentials in the frontend `.env` file _and_ in the WordPress plugin settings.

#### Chromatic

Chromatic automates gathering UI feedback, visual testing, and documentation, so developers can iterate faster with less manual work. You will need to update both [`package.json`](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter/blob/staging/package.json#L34) and [`chromatic.yml`](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter/blob/staging/.github/workflows/chromatic.yml) with your Chromatic API key in order to automate builds.

#### Vercel

Vercel is the company behind Next.js and offers a platform _[that was built for deploying](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs)_ Next.js apps.

Vercel has a generous free tier and offers support for both serverless functions (required if using incremental static regeneration) and [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image). Something neither Netlify nor Cloudflare support.

#### WP Engine

We're a partner with WP Engine and love their managed WordPress hosting options. That said, while hosting your headless WordPress install on WP Engine is recommended, it is not required.

## üöÄ Frontend Setup (Next.js)

The following steps will stand up a local install of Next.js.

### Dependencies

Before you get started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your computer:

- [Node 12](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download)

### Install

**Step 1: Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter.git
```

**Step 2: Change directories**

```bash
cd nextjs-wordpress-starter
```

**Step 3: Install dependencies**

```bash
yarn
```

**Step 4: Setup ENV Variables**

ENV variables are like constants in `wp-config.php`. They're required in order for authentication and 3rd party services to work.

Copy the [sample ENV file](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter/blob/staging/.env.sample), then modify it to match your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

--OR--

[Link the project with Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#commands/overview/project-linking), then pull down the ENV variables:

<details>

The preferred workflow is to add ENV variables to Vercel first, then pull them down.

**Step 1: Add ENV vars to Vercel**

Go to:

```text
Your Project --> Settings --> Environment Variables
```

![vercel settings](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7ljvynnez0c5q8y/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-29%20at%2014.07.58.png?dl=0)

**Step 2: Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download)**

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

**Step 3: Initialize Vercel**

Answer the questions in the command line when prompted.

```bash
vercel init
```

**Step 4: Pull down the ENV variables**

```bash
vercel env pull
```

Now Next.js has what it needs to talk to 3rd party services.

## üîß Backend Setup (WordPress)

The following steps will stand up a local install of WordPress.

### Dependencies

Before you get started, make sure you have the following dependency installed on your computer:

- [Local WP](https://localwp.com/)

### Install

**Step 1: Download the Local WP export**

- [nextjs-wp-01.29.2021.zip (162MB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iTVxyTS6ezy6RUhba9CbAjZL1x3iZyv7/view?usp=sharing)

**Step 2: Import the .zip**

- https://localwp.com/help-docs/getting-started/how-to-import-a-wordpress-site-into-local/

**Step 3: Configure `wp-config.php`**

The follow constants needs to be in `wp-config.php`:

```php
define('HEADLESS_FRONTEND_URL', 'http://localhost:3000/');
define('PREVIEW_SECRET_TOKEN', 'ANY_RANDOM_STRING');
```

**Step 4: Start the `nextjs-wp` site**

### Enable Previews

To enable previews, you'll need both a `PREVIEW_SECRET_TOKEN` constant in `wp-config.php` and `WORDPRESS_PREVIEW_SECRET` ENV variable in `.env`.

The token can be any random string as long as they match.

## üíª Frontend Development

### Git Workflow

1. Create a `feature` branch off `staging`
2. Work locally adhereing to coding standards
3. When ready, open a draft Pull Request on Github
4. When finished, fill out the PR template and publish your PR
5. Your PR must pass assertions and deploy successfully
6. After peer review, the PR will be merged back into `staging`
7. Repeat ‚ôªÔ∏è

### Deployments

[Vercel](https://nextjs-wordpress-starter-gregrickaby.webdevstudios.vercel.app) is connected to this Github repository and will automatically build and deploy. Learn more about [Vercel + Github integration](https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github).

### Storybook

To work with Storybook on your Local, run the following command:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Stories are written in `.mdx` and should be placed next to the component. Learn more about [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## WebDevStudios Specific Info

The following information pertains to internal tools and workflows at WebDevStudios.

<details>

### WordPress Github

There is a Github repo for the backend. This repo manages plugins and the headless theme. Future projects should probably mimic this setup:

https://github.com/WebDevStudios/nextjs-starter-wordpress

**Note: There is no frontend for WordPress** - But it is running a headless theme which houses `/acf-json` and other headless-related functions.

### WP Engine

There are 3 WordPress environments on WP Engine:

- [Develop](https://nextjsdevstart.wpengine.com/wp-admin/)
- [Staging](https://nextjsstgstart.wpengine.com/wp-admin/)
- [Production](https://nextjs.wpengine.com/wp-admin)

Use the orange "WebDevStudios Login" button to log in.

### Chromatic

This project supports UI review via Chromatic, which is triggered via Github Actions.

View this project's [Chromatic](https://chromatic.com/library?appId=5fe0becf19ad53002147b034&branch=staging) by logging in with your WDS Github account.

### 1Password

All of the credentials are in the following vault:

```text
1Password --> Next.js Starter
```

### Migrate DB Pro

You can use Migrate DB Pro to pull databases and files. Please see 1password for credentials

### Algolia

The login and API credentials are in password.

### Copy WP Engine Environments

WP Engine supports [copying environments](https://wpengine.com/support/copy-site/). This should be done at the end of two week sprints (or as needed).

**The following steps will copy Develop to Staging:**

1. Log into the WP Engine [User Portal](https://my.wpengine.com/sites)
2. Click on [Nextjsstgstart](https://my.wpengine.com/installs/nextjsstgstart)
3. In the top right corner, click the "Copy environment" button
4. Select the options:
