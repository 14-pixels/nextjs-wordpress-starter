## üéì Overview

### Why?

It's easy to query a WordPress REST-API and map over some blog posts in JavaScript. That's where many examples on the Internet stop and you'd be hard pressed to find anything about supporting advanced features because **_headless WordPress is hard!_**

At WebDevStudios we believe that WordPress is so much more than a blog-- and our clients require support for things like: SEO, forms, post previews, search, comments, authentication, custom post types, custom fields, etc...

With this starter, we've figured out "the hard stuff" and placed the sum of our knowledge into something the community (and our future projects) could use as a jumping off point.

### How's this all work?

The frontend (Next.js) talks to the backend (WordPress) via GraphQL.

## üíª Frontend Development

### Git Workflow

1. Create a `feature` branch off `staging`
2. Work locally adhereing to coding standards
3. When ready, open a draft Pull Request on Github
4. When finished, fill out the PR template and publish your PR
5. Your PR must pass assertions and deploy successfully
6. After peer review, the PR will be merged back into `staging`
7. Repeat ‚ôªÔ∏è

### Deployments

[Vercel](https://nextjs-wordpress-starter-gregrickaby.webdevstudios.vercel.app) is connected to this Github repository and will automatically build and deploy. Learn more about [Vercel + Github integration](https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github).
