## 🎓 Preface

You will need the following installed on your computer:

- [Node 12](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download)

---

## 🚀 Front-end Setup (Next.js)

The following instructions will standup a local install of Next.js (front-end). It queries data from WordPress (back-end).

**Clone the repo:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter.git
```

**Check out the `staging` branch**

```bash
git checkout staging
```

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
yarn
```

**Create an environment variable file:**

```bash
vercel env pull
```

**Start the development server:**

```bash
yarn dev
```

The frontend is now available at http://localhost:3000

## 🔧 Back-end Setup (WordPress)

The backend is hosted at WP Engine. There are 3 environments...please use Develop for working locally.

- [Develop](https://nextjsdevstart.wpengine.com/wp-admin/)
- [Staging](https://nextjsstgstart.wpengine.com/wp-admin/)
- [Production](https://nextjs.wpengine.com/wp-admin)

**Note: There is no frontend for WordPress** - But it is running [wd_s](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s) which houses `/acf-json` and other functions.

## 💻 Workflow

Contributing to this project is a lot like any other WDS project...

### Local by Flywheel

There is an [Local export available](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ju81KThAUHOuWRNslw_m7xZScwoJYkr0). Simply import the `nextjs-wp-XX.XX.XX.zip` file and you can tinker with the WordPress backend.

### Migrate DB Pro

You can use Migrate DB Pro to pull databases and files. **Please see 1password --> Next.js Starter --> Migrate DB Pro**

### Deployments

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/webdevstudios/nextjs-wordpress-example) is connected to this repo and handles builds and deployments.

### Git Branches

- `develop` - auto deploys on Vercel
- `staging` - auto deploys on Vercel
- `main` - auto deploys on Vercel
- `Pull Requests` - deployment previews are automatically generated by Vercel

### Git Workflow

1. Create a `feature` branch off `staging`
2. Open a draft Pull Request on Github
3. When finished with your work, fill out the PR template and publish your PR
4. Vercel will create a deployment preview. It must pass and deploy successfully
5. After peer review, PR will be merged back into `staging`
6. Repeat ♻️
